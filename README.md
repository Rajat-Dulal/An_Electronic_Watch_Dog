# An Electronic Watch Dog
## Minor Project -- Thapathali Campus
### Software Implemented in Python and hardware Implemented in Aurdino UNO

The concept we have proposed is that of a dog that guards a house and notifies the owner whenever a known or unknown person enters the premises. 
Our project ‘An Electronic Watch Dog’ is simply like a remote-controlled vehicle with a little twist in it. 
The dog has a camera integrated which performs live video capture and sends it to the PC. 
We then use Image Processing for the manipulation of these videos/images and thus, derive information out of them to determine whether the object is a human/person or not. 
Finally, our proposed watch dog project will use the concept of facial recognition and image comparison to determine if the person in the image is the verified individual of the property or not. 
After verification an alert is sent to the owner.
